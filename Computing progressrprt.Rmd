Goals for this project including creating an educational computer game for 2nd-3rd graders.
The game will consist of falling cubes containing mathematical equations. The answer to the problem must be entered before the cube hits the "ground" and shatters.
Used resources will include the Unity game engine, and visual stude integrated development environment (IDE)
Current data we have generated include four 2-D cube shapes colliding with a square sprite, these images were generated in Unity.
These Unity files were uploaded under the file "assets" and uploaded to a public GitHub repository.
One resource that was considered in the visual department of the video game was ASCII art; the code would be embedded into the repository.
The goal of this integration would be to have an image appear after the game ended, either in success or failure of completing the math problems correctly.
